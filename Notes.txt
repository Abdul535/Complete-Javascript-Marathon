******************************************************************************
-write "use strict" on 1st line to say to js that not to declare a variable like [a=45;] without let,const and var
-convention    
    start with small letter and use camelCase
-variable can't start with number (var 1fname) , you can use underscore(_) or dollar($) only
-string.length or array.length basically .length doesn't starts with zero(0) and its .length not .length() not a function at all
-string is immutable in js every string methods [trim(),toUpperCase(),toLowerCase(),slice()] returns a new string doesn't manipulate the original
-converting a number to string just concatenate with ""
    a=88 //typeof a is 'number'
    a=a+"" //typeof a is 'string'
    a=String(a);
-converting a string to number just concatenate with + 
    a = +"34" //typeof a is 'number'
    a=Number(a);
-there is a bug in javascript that typeof null is object,but they didn't change bcoz every library uses like that
-BigInt can be defined in two ways
    let num = BigInt(344);
    let num = 344n;
    any operation can be done if both are BigInt only
